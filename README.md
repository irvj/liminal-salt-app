## Why Liminal Salt?

**For Writers & Roleplayers**
Create unique AI personas with distinct voices and personalities. The app remembers context across all your conversations, making interactions feel more natural and consistent over time.

**For Privacy-Conscious Users**
Runs entirely on your machine. No database, no cloud storage, no tracking. All data is stored locally in simple JSON and Markdown files you can read, edit, or delete anytime.

**For Tinkerers**
Open source and easy to extend. Personas are just Markdown files. Themes are JSON. No complex setup required—just Python and an API key.
